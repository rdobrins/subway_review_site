Welcome to Team Ice Cats' Subway Review Site! This is a group project completed
by Nick Jones, Ryan Dobrinski, Tom Fafard, Alex Keith, and Sebastian Kopp for
Launch Academy.  This was a two week project to complete a review site for an
object of our choosing, so we chose subway stations, so people will have a good
idea of what to expect during their commute.
